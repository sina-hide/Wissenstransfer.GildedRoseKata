# Gilded Rose Kata

This is the Gilded Rose Kata, invented by Terry Hughes
([@TerryHughes](https://twitter.com/TerryHughes)) and published by
Bobby Johnson ([@NotMyself](https://twitter.com/NotMyself)) on his
[Blog](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/14/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose/).

This repository contains the
[non-refactored code](../main/GildedRose.Console/Program.cs) in all it's glory.
Take a look and enjoy it (you shouldn't be afraid of conditionals -- lots of
conditionals).  But before you start refactoring the mess, read the
[description of your task](kata-readme.md) (we always read the documentation
first ;-) ).

Additionally, Emily Bache collected
[lots of versions](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/)
of this kata for different programming languages.

I stumbled across the Gilded Rose Kata in 2020.
